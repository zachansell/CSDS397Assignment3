# CSDS397Assignment3
This is an assignment to use SQL to run basic data transformations on a data set. The data set used can be found in the Data folder. I used Microsoft SQL Server to run the SQL commands, which is relevant since the ingestion script uses a command unique to SQL Server. I believe all other scripts should work in most SQL environments. 

To recreate the tables found in the Data folder, first, download the data set and run the ingestion script in the Ingestion folder. Then, run the transformation scripts to create the tables of the transformed data.
